# Common Voice Community Playbook

* [_License_](https://github.com/Heyhillary/community-playbook/tree/47fbc178e05e47ec192efd51e62f393b31ceacbc/LICENSE.md)

## Vision of Common Voice

## Goals for this playbook

* Provide people interested in contributing to Common Voice goals and mission with clear guidelines and expectations on how to set up and run a self-sustaining Common Voice langauge community.
* Unify existing community knowledge previously documented in different places.
* Be the central place to understand the whole voice community journey.
* Communicate what brings value to the project and how communities can support it.

## Participation Guidelines

Common Voice is governed by Mozilla's code of conduct and etiquette guidelines, we take this very seriously and no violations are tolerated.

We encourage you to please read[ Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/) before contributing to this project. For more information on how to report violations of the Community Participation Guidelines, please read our '[How to Report](https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/reporting/)' page.

## Governance

Mozilla Foundation owns the overall Common Voice project governance and is the ultimate decision maker for its direction and goals. It’s also in charge of the development of some tools and channels described here to support our communities.

Common Voice langauge communities are self-organized, and you don’t need to ask for permission to participate or mobilize any of these communities in your language. All the data generated by communities is published under open licences.

Some community roles exist formally and informally, and they all should follow [the Mozilla leadership shared agreements](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/what-s-next-for-volunteer-leadership-in-2018-shared-agreements/25091).

## Common Voice Ecosystem

Common Voice Ecosystem has a variety of communities that support the project in different important areas, they are usually grouped by language.

Here is a list of some of the [langauge community channels](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/blob/main/docs/COMMUNITIES.md) that you can take part in.

✈️ The journey involves collecting and validating public domain sentences \(1\), recording and validating the recordings of the sentences \(2\), repeating this process to grow the size of the data \(3\), generating a dataset \(4\) and using machine learning to train speech-to-text models using this dataset \(5\).
