# Language Communities and Contributors

üë• You will need a multidisciplinary team of committed people to support your language journey. For some roles, you don‚Äôt have to be able to code to contribute.  

üî® Make sure you check the required skills for each section and look for people who can fit.

üí¨ Check out this page to find existing [language community channels, to communicate with other contributors supporting Common Voice.](https://github.com/common-voice/common-voice/blob/main/docs/COMMUNITIES.md)  

To create a new language community reach out via [Common Voice discourse](https://discourse.mozilla.org/c/voice/239) and encourage new contributors from social networks.  You can adapt these materials to outreach for support. 

‚ÑπÔ∏è  Note: Mozilla‚Äôs focus is to optimize this project, tools and communities for the goals and measures of success described in this document. We welcome small and minority language communities, and we understand these goals may seem out of reach. In that case, feel free to share with us how they are different for you. Nevertheless, we welcome all language communities!
