# Participation Guidelines and Governance

## Participation Guidelines

Common Voice is governed by Mozilla's code of conduct and etiquette guidelines, we take this very seriously and no violations are tolerated.

We encourage you to please read[ Mozilla Community Participation Guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/) before contributing to this project. For more information on how to report violations of the Community Participation Guidelines, please read our '[How to Report](https://www.mozilla.org/about/governance/policies/participation/reporting/)' page

## Governance

Mozilla Foundation owns the overall Common Voice project governance and is the ultimate decision maker for its direction and goals. It’s also in charge of the development of some tools and channels described here to support our communities.

Common Voice langauge communities are self-organized, and you don’t need to ask for permission to participate or mobilize any of these communities in your language. All the data generated by communities is published under open licences.

Some community roles exist formally and informally, and they all should follow [the Mozilla leadership shared agreements](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/what-s-next-for-volunteer-leadership-in-2018-shared-agreements/25091).
